  Tailwind CSS Styling Notes:
  - flex flex-col: Stacks title and list vertically.
  - p-4 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-inner mt-4: Styling for the container, similar to TaskBoard for consistency.
  - text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-gray-800: Styling for the list title.
  - flex flex-col gap-2: Stacks task items vertically with spacing.
  - p-3 bg-white rounded shadow-sm: Styling for each task item container.
  - text-gray-600 line-through: Styles for completed task text (grayed out and struck through).
  - flex items-center: Aligns checkmark and text horizontally.
  - mr-2 text-green-600: Styling for the checkmark icon.
  - flex-1 truncate: Allows the title to take available space and truncate if too long.
  - text-gray-500 italic text-center py-4: Styling for the "No tasks completed" message.
  - aria-* attributes: Added for accessibility.
